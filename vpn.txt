   #> Policy Based VPN    
	  + Site 2 Site IPSec VPN
	  + Hub and Spoke IPSec VPN
	  + Remote Access IPSec VPN
	 
   #> Route Based VPN 
	  + GRE
	  + VTI (Virtual Tunnel Interface) 
		+> Static VTI
		+> Dynamic VTI

	#> DMVPN
	
	#> SSL Based VPN (WebVPN)
	
	   -> Clientless VPN (Limited Access or Resources)
	   -> Anyconnect VPN (Fully Access or Resources)

   #> Policy Based VPN ( Traditional IPSec VPN)
		
		1. Support on ASA and Router
		2. No Multicast
		3. Routing Protocol like OSPF/EIGRP not pass through
		4. Strong security and limited QoS
   
   #> Route Based VPN (GRE/VTI)
   
		1. Only on Router
		2. Support multicast (GRE/VTI)
		3. Routing protocol OSPF/EIGRP can pass through 
		4. QoS fully support but GRE/VTI dont provide security

    # Policy Based VPN Application
	
		1. If we want routing protocol or multicast traffic through tunnel then this will not work.
		2. If remote site WAN is dynamic like PPPoE/DHCP then apply dynamic crytomap on central-hub
		3. IPSec does not support NAT traffic then config NAT exemption.
	
	# Route Based VPN Application
	
		1. If vpn network unicast.. multicast routing then GRE protocol is only option.
		2. ASA does not support GRE. router provides. but GRE does not provide encrytion. it must conjunction with IPSec.
